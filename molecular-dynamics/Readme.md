# Computational Materials Science: Molecular Dynamics

This repository contains Python implementations of key molecular dynamics algorithms and concepts. The code provides a foundation for atomic-scale simulations of materials, focusing on fundamental algorithms in computational materials science.

## Overview

Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computational technique that uses numerical simulations to study the time evolution of molecular, atomic, or particle systems under classical mechanics. It allows for the observation and analysis of the dynamic behavior of molecular systems at the microscopic scale, establishing relationships between the microscopic and macroscopic aspects of the system through statistical physics.
